## ✍️ Commit Rules & Branch Naming

We use <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">Conventional Commits</a> to keep our history clean and readable.

Commit prefixes and branch names should be in the following format:

- `feat:` - ✨ A new feature
- `hotfix:` - 🚑 A critical fix
- `docs:` - 📝 Documentation only changes
- `style:` - 💅 Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor:` - 🔨 A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `chore:` - 👷Dev setup, tooling, config or just some random task
- `bugfix:` - 🐛 A bug fix

Example commit message:

```
feat: added new button component
```

Example commit message with emoji, to make life easier and more fun:

```
✨ feat: added new button component
```

### 🌿 Branch Naming Rules

There are **two ways** of creating a branch:

| Case                                          | Rule                                                                              | Example                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **From an Issue (preferred if Issue exists)** | GitHub auto-adds the Issue number. **Always use this when related Issue exists.** | `feat/123-add-new-button-component`                                                      |
| **Without an Issue**                          | Use standard format with type/purpose.                                            | `feat/add-new-button-component`<br>`hotfix/fix-login-crash`<br>`bugfix/button-alignment` |

## 📝Folder Structure and Naming Conventions

- cypress - contains all the e2e tests
- public - contains static assets like images, icons, etc.
- src - contains the main application code
  - api - contains API requests and related code
  - data - contains static data in Russian, English and Armenian languages
  - assets - contains static assets like images, icons, etc.
  - components - reusable components
  - hooks - custom React hooks
  - layouts - layout components
  - lib - utility functions and libraries
  - local-types - local shareable types used in the project
  - pages - Next.js pages
  - styles - global styles and variables

---

## 📦 Import Order Guidelines

To keep the project structure consistent, please follow this import order in files:

- Third-party libraries (e.g., React, Next.js, lodash)

- Global styles (/src/styles)

- Constants (/src/constants)

- Helpers (/src/helpers)

- Types (/src/types)

- Hooks (/src/hooks)

- Lib (/src/lib)

- Api (/src/api)

- Components (/src/components)

- Layouts (/src/layouts)

- Features (/src/features)

- Assets (/public/images, SVGs, icons) - \*But in general we will be using Icon component

- Local styles

---

## ⚙️ Component Files

```
Each Component have its own folder with the following structure:
src/components/ComponentName/
src/components/ComponentName/index.tsx
src/components/ComponentName/ComponentName.tsx
src/components/ComponentName/ComponentName.module.scss
src/components/ComponentName/ComponentName.types.ts

Same approach applies to Layouts.
```

<p align="left">
  <strong style="font-size: 13px; vertical-align: middle;"> ❗️Some components don't have separate types, instead types are defined directly in the component file.
That's an old approach, but we will be moving to the new one gradually.</strong>
</p>
