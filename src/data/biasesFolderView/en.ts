  intro: [
    `The project's idea is to make knowledge about thinking patterns (cognitive biases) more accessible to people.
We agree with a multitude of scientists who believe that this knowledge is one of the most important pieces of information for every person, as it allows for improving decision-making quality throughout life.`,
    `Just like a software system where you need to read the documentation before modifying it, UX Core allows you to read your own mind's "documentation," get to know yourself better, and adjust your thought processes in the most effective way.`,
    `Here, you will find 105 cognitive biases (thinking patterns) with simple descriptions, brief usage examples, and detailed explanations of how a particular bias can be identified and applied in real-life situations.`,
    `This project is sustained solely through your support. Please share it with your network. Thank you!`,
